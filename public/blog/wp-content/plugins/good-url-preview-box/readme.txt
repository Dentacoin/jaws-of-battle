This plugin adds link preview box to your post. You just copied & pasted an URL into your posting. :-)

== Description ==

The Plugin adds an link preview box to your post.
The link preview box will be displayed like in Facebook! :-)

This plugin can be used for free for maximal 10 URL Preview Boxes.

Perhaps you are familiar with Facebook.
When you write a post in Facebook and you paste an URL into your text,
Facebook detects that URL and adds automatically information about that URL under your post.

This plugin does it not automatically, you have to use the extra button in the visual editor ("URL BOX").
Or you just write \[urlpreviewbox url="\https://...."\] into your text.
This plugin loads information about that URL from https://guteurls.de/ server.

1. Title of that page
2. Description of that page
3. An URL of an image

And the plugin displays it below your post.

Facebook supports only one preview box per post.
This plugin supports many preview boxes within one post, if you want.

Do you want to see it live on production servers?

Look here (copy and paste the URLs into your browser):

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I NOT see a preview box, when I write a post =

This is correct. If you want to see the preview box, then you have to exit the admin area.
What you have to do is, save/update your post and then click on "View post" and then you see it.

= Why does the preview box sometimes does not show up? =

Sometimes there are not enough data to fill the preview box.
We do not support pdf-links, mp3-links, m4-links, ...
Only html pages are supported.

= Why does the preview box sometimes shows up only after reload? =

It needs time to collect data from other webpages
and sometimes we have to make a screenshot from the page.
That needs some seconds.
When you click reload, then the data are available/collected/cached.


== Internationalization (i18n) ==
Currently we have the plugin configured so it can be easily translated and the following languages supported:
